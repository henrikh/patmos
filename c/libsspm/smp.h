/*

Message massing framework for message passing between core using a shared scratchpad memory
that utilises time division multiplexing.

Message passing is achieved using dedicated input channels for each core that are accessable by all cores.
The channel is a FIFO queue that does not take the sender into account.
So if core 1 wants to send to core 2, core 1 sends to core 2's input channel. If core 3 wants to send to core 2, it does the exact same as core 1.

There is no dedicated channels between cores, and all channels are active at all times.

Currently, the channels do not support blocking. There is no way for the sender to know whether the
receiving core has gotten the message except for going through its channel to look for the message.

Atomicity is assumed managed by the TDMA.
